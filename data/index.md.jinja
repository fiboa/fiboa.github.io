## Add your dataset

See the [how to](create.md) if you want to create your own fiboa-compliant dataset.

Once your dataset is ready, you have two options to add your dataset:

1. If it has a STAC Collection for it, edit [this file](https://github.com/fiboa/fiboa.github.io/edit/main/stac/catalog.json), add your Collection as a child to the STAC catalog, and lastly create a PR.
2. In all other cases, edit [this file](https://github.com/fiboa/fiboa.github.io/edit/main/data/external.yaml), add your dataset to the list of external datasets, and lastly create a PR.

Once the PR is merged your data will be listed here shortly after (it's updated at least every night).
